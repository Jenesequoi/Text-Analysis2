# Text-Analysis2
Text analysis of WWRWTW 2.0 

This analysis was conducted on posit cloud because the sentiments dictonary "nrc" was unavailable with the version or RStudio desktop.
The particular error:
Error: 'C:/Users/x/AppData/Local/textdata/textdata/Cache/nrc/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt' does not exist.
The solutions for the error provided here and other platfroms did not seem to work but it worked online. Next step will be to update the desktop version of RStudio on my PC.
Anyway, here is the outcome.
